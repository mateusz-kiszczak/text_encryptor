## How to use

1. Enter the text your want to encrypt.
2. Choose cipher. You can use predefined buttons (A, B, C, D) or enter your own positive/negative integer as a cipher value.
3. App will shift the characters forward or backwards depending on the cipher's value (positive - forward, negative - backward).
4. Shifted characters are small letters (a-z), large letters (A-Z) and digits (0-9). Any other character will stay the same.
5. Encrypted text will appear at the bottom of the section.
6. To decrypt the text back, use the same way.
7. Remember to use the same cipher's value that you used to encrypt when you decrypt your text.
